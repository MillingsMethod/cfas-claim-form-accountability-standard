    ├── CHANGELOG.md# CFAS™ — Claim-Form Accountability Standard

## Overview

CFAS™ defines a governance standard for AI systems that produce outputs in claim form.

It establishes that:

If an output is structured, interpreted, and used as a claim, it must satisfy claim-level logical consistency.

## Problem

AI systems generate outputs probabilistically but present them as claims, creating a gap in accountability.

## Solution

CFAS introduces:

- Claim-Form Accountability Principle
- Claim-Form Gate (CFG)
- Output-Level Consistency Enforcement

## Regulatory Alignment

- EU AI Act (Articles 9, 13, 14, 15)
- ISO/IEC 42001

## Certification

Systems can achieve CFAS-Certified™ status by meeting defined compliance criteria.

Millings Layering Method™ / Authored Intelligence (AHI)# CFAS™ Specification v1.0

## Core Rule

Any output structured as a claim SHALL be evaluated under claim-consistency constraints.

## Definitions

Claim-Form Output:
A statement that asserts or implies a proposition about reality.

## Requirements

1. Claim Detection
2. Consistency Tracking
3. Contradiction Handling
4. Output Qualification
5. Audit Logging

## Claim-Form Gate (CFG)

Inserted between validation and execution.

Function:
- Detect claims
- Evaluate consistency
- Block or qualify outputs

## Compliance

A system is compliant if:
- contradictions are addressed
- outputs are consistent or qualified# CFAS Audit Checklist

- [ ] Claim detection implemented
- [ ] Contradiction tracking enabled
- [ ] Resolution mechanism exists
- [ ] Output qualification present
- [ ] Claim-Form Gate active
